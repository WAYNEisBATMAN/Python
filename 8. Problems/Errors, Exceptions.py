"""Python Errors and Built-in Exceptions"""

"""
A python program terminates as soon as interpreter encounters an unhandled error. 
These errors can be broadly classified into two classes:

1. Syntax/Parsing errors ---> Error caused by not following the proper structure (syntax) of the language.
2. Logical errors/ Exceptions ---> Errors that occur at runtime (after passing the syntax test).
