"""
Module ---> A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. 
            A module can define functions, classes and variables. 
            A module can also include runnable code. 
            Modules provide reusability of code.
            Grouping related code into a module makes the code easier to understand and use.

"""
Import Statement ---> We can use any Python source file as a module by executing an import statement 
                      in some other Python source file.


                      Syntax --->  import filename
